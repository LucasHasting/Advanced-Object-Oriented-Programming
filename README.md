# Advanced Object Oriented Programming
This repository contains all the programs made in my Advanced Object Oriented Programming class.  

The programs are written in [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and some use [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/).

Download the files: download the repo by downloading the [ZIP](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) or by using [git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git).
